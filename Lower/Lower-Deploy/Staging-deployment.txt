1. Give all builds
2. check What are the processes running before deployment
3. check wheather all processes are started or not after deployment
4. After deployment Trobleshooting
 -> if the services not started properly stop and start the clusters
		/data/start_stop_services.sh stop clustera
		/data/start_stop_services.sh stop clusterb
		/data/start_stop_services.sh start clustera
		/data/start_stop_services.sh start clusterb
 -> check the logs the moment deployed
 -> cluster logs (better check BotsServiceAlerts) will show "koreq inited" remaing logs will show port numbers
 -> for ml => curl http://localhost:6006/ml/healthcheck
	Response: {"server_status": "Server is up and running", "mongo_status": "Server is connected to Mongo", "redis_status": "Server is connected to Redis"}
 -> for Lemmatizer =>  curl http://staging-bots-blue.mllemmatizer.korebots.com
	Response: Server is up and running
 -> open https://staging-bots.korebots.com/. check FAQ and traing is working or not
