nginx:

-> 	some of servers we have nginx conf (integrations.conf) and wb_nginx

-> 	In general nginx run with "integrations.conf" -> do ps -ef | grep nginx to know path

-> 	In "integrations.conf" we are upstreaming all the ports of required services which don't required ssl and we defined the path of these services to host in the web

-> The services which requires ssl are defined in the "sslInfra.conf" and calling "sslInfra.conf" in "integrations.conf"

-> All the static services are defined in the "static.conf" and calling "static.conf" in "integrations.conf"
